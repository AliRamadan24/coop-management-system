# coop-management-system


initial push, to run the code, write "python seed.py", then "python app.py" in the terminal and these are the test users. 
coop.db is the sql file that gets created once you run those lines above. Add some more users and play around with it, if you wanna 
convert it to "MySQL", go ahead. When u wanna open the file, just click on the host link that pops up when u run the python app.py line.
When u wanna close it and stop running, just make sure ur cursor is in the terminal and press "ctrl+c".
